## üåü The "Vibe" (Concept & Inspiration)
*Clearly articulate your project's core "vibe." What problem are you tackling, or what innovative idea are you exploring? What was your primary inspiration for this project in the context of cybersecurity? How does it relate to the "Vibe Coding for Security" theme?*

---

## ü§ñ How AI is Used (Implementation & Effectiveness)
*Describe in detail how AI is integrated into your project. Be specific!*
* **AI Models/Platforms/Tools:** (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama, specific Hugging Face models, local LLMs, Vertex AI, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
* **Role of AI in Development:** (e.g., "Used an LLM to brainstorm architectural approaches," "Generated boilerplate code for API interaction using Copilot," "AI helped debug specific functions.")
* **Role of AI in Project Functionality:** (e.g., "The core engine uses an LLM to analyze suspicious network traffic patterns," "AI generates natural language explanations of identified vulnerabilities," "The tool employs a machine learning model to classify malware.")
* **Why was this AI approach chosen? How effective is it?**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Relevance & Potential Impact
*Explain the significance of your project to the cybersecurity field.*
* **Target Audience/Use Case:** (e.g., SOC analysts, penetration testers, security auditors, developers)
* **Problem Solved:** How does your project address a specific cybersecurity challenge?
* **Potential Impact:** What benefits could your project offer (e.g., improved detection rates, faster response times, reduced workload, new defensive/offensive capabilities)?

## üõ†Ô∏è Functionality & Features
*What does your project actually do? List its key features and how they work.*
* Feature 1: ...
* Feature 2: ...
* (Add as many as needed)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage
*Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to get your project running.*
* **Prerequisites:** (e.g., Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, Docker, specific Python libraries from `requirements.txt`)
* **API Keys & Environment Variables:** (List any required API keys, e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`. **IMPORTANT: Remind users NOT to commit their actual keys. Suggest using a `.env` file and provide a `.env.example`.)**
* **Installation:** (e.g., `git clone ...`, `cd your_project_folder`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`)
* **Configuration:** (Any specific setup steps, e.g., "Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API key.")
* **Running the Project:** (e.g., `python main.py --input <file>`, `streamlit run app.py`, `docker-compose up`)

---

## üé¨ Demo (Link to Video/GIFs - Highly Recommended!)
*A visual demonstration is key to showing off your "vibe"!*
* **[Link to your Demo Video (e.g., YouTube, Loom, Google Drive) or embed GIFs here]**
* *Briefly describe what the demo shows.*

---

## ü§î Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned (Optional but good for sharing)
*What were some of the interesting hurdles you overcame? What did you learn during this vibe coding journey? (e.g., prompt engineering difficulties, unexpected AI outputs, limitations of certain models for your task)*

---

## üöÄ Future Ideas (Optional)
*If you had more time or resources, how would you evolve this project? What other features or capabilities could be added?*
