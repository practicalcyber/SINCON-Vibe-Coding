# SINCON 2025 AI Kampung: Vibe Coding for Security - Project Submissions

![SINCON Logo](https://www.infosec-city.com/images/logo_white.png) **Welcome to the official project submission repository for the SINCON 2025 AI Kampung!**

This year, the AI Kampung is all about **"Vibe Coding for Security"** ‚Äì a hands-on, AI-powered playground where cybersecurity practitioners don't just talk about innovation, they build it. Whether you're red, blue, or somewhere in between, this is your space to experiment, code, and deploy your own cybersecurity tooling with the help of next-gen AI systems.

## üöÄ The Challenge: Vibe Coding for Security

Got a "vibe" for a cool, innovative, or just plain useful security tool or concept? An idea that could help defenders, illuminate attacker techniques, or automate a tedious security task? That's what we want to see!

"Vibe Coding" is about starting with that initial spark ‚Äì the *vibe* ‚Äì and then harnessing the power of AI (think Large Language Models, code generation, AI-assisted analysis, etc.) to help bring your concept to life. Don't worry if it's not a fully polished enterprise-ready product; we're looking for:

* **Innovative ideas:** What's the core concept or "vibe"?
* **Creative use of AI:** How are you leveraging AI in your project's development, functionality, or both?
* **Practical potential:** Could this idea, even in its early stages, be useful or insightful for the cybersecurity community?
* **The "Wow" factor:** Does your project have that unique spark?

## Submission Guidelines

This repository is where you'll submit your projects for the AI Kampung.

**1. Fork this Repository:**
   Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

**2. Create Your Project Folder:**
   In your forked repository, create a new folder for your project. Please name it something unique and descriptive, ideally incorporating your team name or your GitHub username (e.g., `TeamAwesomeProject` or `YourName-KillerSecurityTool`).

**3. Project Structure:**
   Inside your project folder, we encourage you to include:
    * **`README.md` (Project-Specific):** Essential! See the "Your Project's README" section below.
    * **`src/` or `code/`:** A folder containing your source code.
    * **`assets/` (Optional):** Any supporting images, diagrams, or data files.
    * **`demo/` (Optional but Recommended):** A short video (link to it in your README) or a set of GIFs demonstrating your project.
    * **`.gitignore`:** (We've included a general Python/AI one in this main repo, feel free to adapt it).

**4. Your Project's README (`your_project_folder/README.md`):**
   This is crucial for the judges and other participants to understand your project. Please use the `project_readme_template.md` (available in the `/templates` folder of this repository) as a starting point. It should cover:
    * **Project Title:**
    * **Team Name / Your Name(s):**
    * **The "Vibe":** What's the core idea/problem you're addressing?
    * **How AI is Used:** Be specific! Which AI models, techniques, or platforms did you use and for what purpose (e.g., code generation, data analysis, UI creation, core logic)?
    * **Functionality:** What does your project do?
    * **Setup & Usage:** How can someone run your project? (Include dependencies, API keys needed, etc.)
    * **Challenges Faced:** (Optional, but interesting!)
    * **Future Ideas:** (Optional)
    * **Demo Link:** (If you have one)

**5. Making a Submission:**
   * **[Option 1: Pull Request - Preferred for visibility during the event]**
        Once your project is ready in your forked repository, create a Pull Request (PR) from your fork back to *this* main repository. Title your PR clearly, e.g., "Project Submission: TeamAwesomeProject". This allows us to see all submissions in one place.
   * **[Option 2: Direct Link - If PRs are not feasible for participants]**
        Alternatively, if specified by organizers, you might submit a direct link to your project folder within your forked repository via a form or email (details to be provided by AI Kampung organizers).

**6. Deadline for Submissions:**
   * **[To Be Announced - e.g., End of Day 1 of SINCON 2025, May 22, 2025, 11:59 PM SGT]**
   *(Please replace with actual deadline)*

## Judging Criteria (General Vibe)

While specific criteria might be detailed closer to the event, projects will generally be judged on:

* üí° **Innovation & Originality of the "Vibe":** How unique and interesting is the core concept?
* ü§ñ **Effective Use of AI:** How well was AI integrated into the project's development or functionality?
* üõ°Ô∏è **Cybersecurity Relevance & Potential Impact:** How applicable or useful is this to the infosec field?
* ‚ú® **Overall Presentation & "Coolness" Factor:** How well is the project presented (README, demo) and does it have that special spark?
* üõ†Ô∏è **Functionality/Execution (within the vibe coding context):** Does the project demonstrate the core idea, even if it's a prototype?

## Getting Help

* If you have questions about the submission process, ask the AI Kampung organizers during SINCON 2025.
* For issues with this GitHub repository template, you can open an "Issue" here.

## Let the Vibe Coding Begin!

We're incredibly excited to see what amazing security tools and concepts you'll build with the power of AI. Good luck, have fun, and happy hacking!
