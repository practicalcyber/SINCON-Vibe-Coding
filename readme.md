**Welcome to the official project submission repository for the SINCON 2025 AI Kampung!**

This year, we're diving deep into **"Vibe Coding for Security"**. The AI Kampung is your hands-on, AI-powered playground. It's not about just talking about innovation in cybersecurity ‚Äì it's about *building* it. Whether you're red, blue, or somewhere in between, this is your space to experiment, code, and deploy your own cybersecurity tooling with the help of next-gen AI systems.

*"Some say it's good, some say it's bad. We say, let's play with it!"*

## üöÄ The Challenge: Vibe Coding for Security

Got a "vibe" for a groundbreaking security tool? An idea that could revolutionize defense, illuminate attacker methodologies, or streamline a complex security process? That's the essence of Vibe Coding!

Start with your innovative concept ‚Äì your *vibe* ‚Äì and then leverage the power of AI to bring it to life. We're looking for you to explore, create, and demonstrate:

* **Innovative Security Applications:** Think AI for autonomous threat hunting, intelligent alert prioritization, AI-driven vulnerability discovery, or using LLMs for secure code generation and review.
* **Creative Use of AI:** How are you integrating AI into your project? Is AI assisting your development process, or is it a core component of your tool's functionality? Show us your ingenious AI implementations!
* **Practical Impact:** How can your project make a tangible difference in the cybersecurity landscape?

**This AI Kampung is open to all SINCON participants. Whether you're an AI guru or just AI-curious, a seasoned coder or a beginner, your "vibe" is what matters most!**

## What to Build? (Inspiration from the "Vibes")

Let your creativity run wild! Here are some areas to spark your imagination:

* **AI for Red Teams:**
    * Automated recon and OSINT gathering
    * AI-assisted payload generation or adaptation
    * Intelligent phishing campaign creation
* **AI for Blue Teams:**
    * Smart log analysis and anomaly detection
    * AI-powered incident response playbooks
    * Predictive threat intelligence
* **AI for Security Operations:**
    * Automating compliance checks
    * Natural language interfaces for security tools
    * AI-driven security awareness training tools
* **AI for Secure Development:**
    * LLM-assisted secure code generation and review
    * Automated creation of test cases for security vulnerabilities

**The key is to demonstrate a tangible outcome ‚Äì a working prototype, a proof-of-concept, or a tool that showcases your vibe in action.**

## Submission Guidelines

This repository is where you'll submit your projects for the AI Kampung.

**1. Fork this Repository:**
   Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

**2. Create Your Project Folder:**
   In your forked repository, create a new folder for your project. Please name it something unique and descriptive, ideally incorporating your team name or your GitHub username (e.g., `TeamCyberAI` or `YourName-ThreatScannerAI`).

**3. Project Structure:**
   Inside your project folder, we strongly encourage you to include:
    * **`README.md` (Project-Specific):** Essential! See the "Your Project's README" section below. Use the template provided in `/templates/project_readme_template.md`.
    * **`src/` or `code/`:** A folder containing your source code.
    * **`assets/` (Optional):** Any supporting images, diagrams, or data files.
    * **`demo/` (Highly Recommended):** A short video (link to it in your README) or a set of GIFs demonstrating your project. This is crucial for showcasing your "vibe"!
    * **`.gitignore`:** (A general Python/AI one is in this main repo; adapt as needed).

**4. Your Project's README (`your_project_folder/README.md`):**
   This is how you'll explain your project's "vibe" and functionality. It's critical for the judges and community. Please use the `project_readme_template.md` from the `/templates` folder. It should cover:
    * **Project Title:**
    * **Team Name / Your Name(s):**
    * **The "Vibe":** What's the core idea/problem you're addressing? What was your inspiration?
    * **How AI is Used:** Be specific! Which AI models (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama, local models), techniques, or platforms did you use? How did AI assist in development and/or how is it part of the tool's functionality?
    * **Functionality:** What does your project do? What are its key features?
    * **Setup & Usage:** How can someone run your project? (Include dependencies, API keys needed ‚Äì *do not commit your keys!*, environment setup).
    * **Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned:** (Optional, but insightful!)
    * **Demo Link:** (Essential if you have a video/GIFs).

**5. Making a Submission:**
   * **Pull Request (PR):** Once your project is ready in your forked repository, create a Pull Request from your fork back to *this* main `[your-org-name]/[this-repo-name]` repository.
        * Title your PR clearly: `Project Submission: [Your Project Name] - [Team Name/Your Name]`
        * This helps us track all submissions and allows for easy viewing.

**6. Deadline for Submissions:**
   * **[To Be Confirmed by AI Kampung Organizers - e.g., End of Day 1, SINCON 2025, May 22nd, 2025, 23:59 SGT]**
   *(Please update this with the exact deadline communicated at the AI Kampung!)*
